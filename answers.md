  1.Components of a DBMS
   Database Engine: Processes and retrieves data.
   DDL: Defines database structure (e.g., tables).
   DML: Manages data (insert, update, delete).
   Query Processor: Executes queries.
   Transaction Manager: Ensures reliable transactions.
   Metadata Manager: Handles database schema info.
   Security: Controls user access.


2.Relational Database
A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns, using relationships between tables.

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server.



3.Classifications of SQl
-DDL- Defines database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `DROP`).
-DML- Manages data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`).
-DCL- Controls access (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).



4.Primary Key vs. Foreign Key
-Primary Key- Uniquely identifies a row; no duplicates or `NULL`.
-Foreign Key- Links one table to another; references a primary key.



 5.Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
A diagram showing entities (tables), their attributes, and relationships between them.



6.Advantages of Relational Databases
1.Ensures data accuracy.
2.Easy to query with SQL.
3.Scalable for large data.
4.Reduces redundancy with normalization.


 7.Data Types in Tables
1.Integer- Whole numbers.
2.String- Text (e.g., `VARCHAR`).
3.Date/Time- Dates and times.
4.Decimal- Precise numbers.



 8.Purpose of a DBMS
To store, manage, and retrieve data securely and efficiently while supporting multiple users.
